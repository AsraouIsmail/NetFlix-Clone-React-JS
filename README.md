NetFlix Clone Build with React Js
In this project i build my first clone project in REACT JS . i used to implement the TMDB API and the Trailer feature of the Netflix Originals. this project covers  deep concepts of React. 

This build covers  concept of React Hooks(useState, useEffect) & React props also.
also i used to implement the Movie Trailer feature in this build and the implementation of Axios.
